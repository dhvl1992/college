            <h3>Ancient Port City of Gujarat</h3>
            <div style="margin-top: 40px;">
                <p>Bharuch is a district in the southern Gujarat peninsula, on the west coast of India. It has a similar size and population to Greater Boston. It is located at the mouth of the Narmada River, which connects it to the inland locations of Surat peninsula on which Gujarat is situated, making connections to the West, such as Egypt, Greece, Persia and Rome. It was part of the Shaka and Silk routes, and a hub for land and sea commerce. Bharuch's significance declined with the emergence of deep-sea navigation, as it was not a convenient location for ships that could sail across the oceans.</p>
